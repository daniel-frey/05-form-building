#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Daneiel completed the solo lab. It took about 5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. Friday in class we completed about 80% of the assignment
  2. I started off by going over the files, reading the TODO, and familiarizing myself with how the code runs.
  3. The first thing I did was to hide the export containter until it was populated with JSON
  4. Then I built the published on date checkbox
  5. Once that was finished and the app was essentially completed I used JSON stringify to allow for the easy export into the DB.
